The simple List component is a user interface (UI) element commonly used in software applications and websites to display a set of related items in a vertical or horizontal list format. It can be used to display a variety of information, such as navigation links, product listings, or task lists.

The list component consists of a container that holds a series of individual list items. Each list item contains the content to be displayed, such as text, images, or icons. The list items are typically separated by a horizontal or vertical divider line to visually distinguish them.

In addition to displaying information, the simple List component can also be interactive. For example, clicking on a list item can trigger an action, such as navigating to a new page or opening a dropdown menu. List components can also be styled with different colors, fonts, and spacing to match the visual design of the application or website.
