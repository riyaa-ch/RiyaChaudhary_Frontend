In the WrappedSingleListItem, the onClickHandler is not being invoked properly. Instead of being called when the list item is clicked, the onClickHandler is being called immediately when the component is rendered. The correct code should be: onClick={()=>onClickHandler(index)}

The proptypes for index and isSelected should be isRequired as well. The correct code should be: WrappedSingleListItem.propTypes = { index: PropTypes.number.isRequired, isSelected: PropTypes.bool.isRequired, onClickHandler: PropTypes.func.isRequired, text: PropTypes.string.isRequired, };

Incorrect syntax of useState() hook. The useState() hook returns an array of two elements where the first element is the state value and the second element is a function to update the state value. The array elements need to be swapped. The correct code should be: const [selectedIndex, setSelectedIndex] = useState(0); in the items.map() function, each child in a list should have a unique key prop. Also, the isSelected prop should be passed as a boolean, instead it is being passed as a selectedIndex state value. The correct code should be: {items.map((item, index) => ( <SingleListItem key={index} onClickHandler={() => handleClick(index)} text={item.text} index={index} isSelected={index===selectedIndex} /> ))}
